The new SQLAlchemy Tutorial is now integrated between Core and ORM and serves as a unified introduction to SQLAlchemy as a whole. In the new 2.0 style of working, fully available in the 1.4 release, the ORM now uses Core-style querying with the select() construct, and transactional semantics between Core connections and ORM sessions are equivalent. Take note of the blue border styles for each section, that will tell you how “ORM-ish” a particular topic is!
